## [0.1.8] - 2025-11-25

This release addresses a critical bug causing unphysical gravothermal collapse in NFW SIDM simulations. It also achieves byte-for-byte reproducibility with a new deterministic RNG and unifies the serial and parallel physics implementations.

### Notes

*   Fixes a critical bug exclusive to the NFW profile introduced in the last update. The issue caused uninitialized particle data, leading to excess correlations and rapid, unphysical gravothermal collapse in SIDM simulations.

### Changed

*   **Physics and Numerics:**
    *   Replaced the per-thread GSL RNG system for SIDM scattering with a deterministic, counter-based hash RNG to ensure byte-for-byte reproducibility in parallel SIDM simulations.
    *   The serial SIDM implementation now calls the same core physics function as the parallel version, unifying the physics logic.

*   **Performance:**
    *   Scatter calculations have been optimized with a branchless orthonormal basis construction to improve CPU pipeline efficiency.

*   **User Interface:**
    *   Trajectory plot labels now use scientific notation for very small angular momentum values to improve readability.

### Fixed

*   **Physics and Numerics:**
    *   Corrected a double-allocation bug in the NFW initialization pathway that caused memory leaks and left phi angle data uninitialized, leading to unphysical gravothermal collapse.
    *   Fixed an issue where all particles were initialized with positive angular momentum; sign is now correctly randomized to restore rotational symmetry. This had no physical consequences for simulation evolution.
    *   Corrected the sorting logic for the "lowest absolute L" mode to use `fabs(L)`, which ensures it selects particles with the smallest angular momentum.

*   **Simulation Workflow:**
    *   Simplified the logic for the simulation extend mode to hand off to the more robust restart machinery, fixing an issue that caused duplicate snapshots.

*   **Documentation:**
    *   Updated command-line help and Sphinx documentation with profile-specific parameter defaults and converted all remaining Unicode symbols to LaTeX math notation.

### Removed

*   **Code Quality:**
    *   The GSL RNG state array for parallel threads (`g_rng_per_thread`) has been removed, as it is now obsolete.
    *   The separate, inline C code for the serial version of SIDM scattering has been removed in favor of the unified core function.

## [0.1.7] - 2025-10-28

This major release introduces constant-β and Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy models for all density profiles, overhauls the simulation restart/extend system, and adds memory-optimized I/O with trajectory and double-precision snapshot buffers. It also includes a fix for the parallel SIDM implementation and standardizes all code and user documentation.

### Added

*   **Anisotropy and Profile Models:**
    *   Added constant-β anisotropy support for all profiles (analytical for Hernquist with hypergeometric functions for β ∈ [-1, 0.5]; numerical for NFW and Cored).
    *   Added the Osipkov-Merritt (OM) model for radially-varying velocity anisotropy β(r) = r²/(r² + r_a²) for all three density profiles.
    *   Added automatic detection and handling of negative f(E) or f(Q) values during initial conditions generation.

*   **Simulation Infrastructure:**
    *   Implemented a fixed-size circular buffer architecture for trajectory tracking that reduces memory usage and increases I/O speed. This is configurable via `--snapshot-buffer`.
    *   Implemented a 4-snapshot rolling buffer storing float64 data for high-precision analysis, which is integrated with the restart/extend system and is backward compatible.
    *   Added a framework for tracking total kinetic energy, potential energy, and energy conservation, with output to `total_energy_vs_time.dat`.

*   **User Interface and Tooling:**
    *   Added infrastructure for Jupyter Notebooks, including automatic notebook signing on environment activation and a new example notebook that reproduces all 7 figures from the velocity-anisotropy paper.
    *   Added 10 new options for anisotropy, restart/extend, and particle selection. All 37 options are now documented.

### Changed

*   **Physics and Numerics:**
    *   The default behavior now selects particles with the lowest true angular momentum values. The previous "closest to target" behavior is preserved via the `--lvals-target` flag.
    *   Particle arrays now have 6 components to persistently store randomized phi angles.
    *   A minimum critical radius is now enforced to ensure the Levi-Civita integrator is used at very small radii independent of the angular momentum value for numerical stability.

*   **Performance:**
    *   The sorting system now may adaptively select the fastest algorithm (insertion, quadsort, or radix sort) at runtime based on performance benchmarks.

*   **Code Quality:**
    *   Overhauled all Doxygen comments to a standardized format. All informal language, first-person pronouns, and meta-tags have been removed, and mathematical notation now uses LaTeX.

### Fixed

*   **Simulation Workflow:**
    *   Fixed a series of bugs in the restart/extend system that caused trajectory corruption and timing errors, achieving bit-for-bit reproducibility.
    *   Corrected the restart/extend logic to ensure all 7 auxiliary file types and the double-precision snapshot buffers are now properly handled for complete state transfer.

*   **Physics and Numerics:**
    *   Corrected a bug in the parallel implementation that caused some scatter events to overwrite the final state from prior scattering in the same timestep by implementing a graph coloring algorithm.
    *   Replaced an additive method with a multiplicative one for spline monotonicity enforcement, correcting errors in potential calculations.
    *   Corrected the core `dt` calculation from `tfinal/Ntimes` to `tfinal/(Ntimes-1)` to ensure consistent time alignment.
    *   Fixed a bug in the sign reconstruction for the `--lvals-target` feature, which previously only worked correctly when the target L was 0.

*   **Reproducibility:**
    *   Corrected an issue where simulations could use a seed of 0; now ensures unique seed generation by using system time including microseconds.

*   **Documentation:**
    *   Resolved multiple issues that broke Doxygen/Sphinx builds, including incorrect parsing of `__attribute__`, parameter name mismatches, and invalid fields in example notebooks.

### Removed

*   **Code Quality:**
    *   Converted all NumPy-style docstrings to standard Doxygen and removed duplicate documentation from forward declarations, reducing code size by over 300 lines.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-04-27

This release improves multiprocessing stability, enhances macOS plotting compatibility, and updates dependency handling with flexible version requirements. These updates, excluding the Virtual Environment update, were meant to be included in v0.1.1 but were inadvertently omitted from that package.

### Fixed

*   **Multiprocessing:** Eliminated repetitive "Could not verify project root" warnings by limiting messages to the main process; improved multiprocessing stability and configuration on macOS.
*   **macOS:** Addressed plotting backend issues for Dock icon behavior by setting Matplotlib to non-interactive 'Agg' backend globally.

### Changed

*   **Dependencies:** Updated `requirements.txt` to use flexible minimum version constraints (e.g., `>=X.Y`) instead of exact matches (`==X.Y.Z`).
*   **Build Process:** Improved project root path detection logic for robustness across execution contexts.

### Added

*   **Virtual Environment:** Enhanced activation script with clearer guidance when users forget to use the 'source' command.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-04-24

This release focuses on improving build system robustness across platforms (especially Windows and macOS), enhancing documentation, adding citation support, and fixing several bugs identified since the initial beta.

### Notes

*   **Correction:** While improvements to multiprocessing stability, macOS plotting compatibility, and dependency versioning were correctly described in the commit message and CHANGELOG.md for v0.1.1, the actual code changes for these features were inadvertently omitted when packaging the release. These changes are fully implemented in v0.1.2.

### Added

*   **Citation Support:** Implemented formal citation infrastructure (`CITATION.cff`) and validation workflow to ensure proper academic citations.
*   **Dynamic Cache Sizing:** Added dynamic L3 cache detection for optimized sorting performance on Linux and macOS.
